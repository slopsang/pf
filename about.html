 						<h1>Hi there</h1>
						<h4>I am Sang Kim, a junior at the University of Washington, Seattle, majoring a BS in Informatics. I was born and raised in Seoul, South Korea and relocated to Seattle in 2011 to attend UW. While never forgetting where I come from, I would like to turn the beautiful city of Seattle into my second home and my professional platform. <br><br>
						I am determined, resilient, organized and persistent man who like to explore new experiences and challenges in my life. I also have a passion for traveling, teaching, and learning about new cultures and serving my community. Oh and I love skateboarding!<br><br>
						I am passionate about learning the world of data. During my free time, I am teaching myself SQL and Tableau through online tutorials. I am planning to take Data Visualization course (D3) and Database management course (SQL) during next quarter before Summer. My interests include software development, data analyst and inclusive user experience design. 
						<!-- Besides coding and designing, I enjoy traveling and teaching. I have traveled 11 countries so far. I like traveling because  I was also a Drill Sergeant at 30th Mechanized Infantry Division RTC for about 2 years. I trained over 3,500 recruits during the service term and taught them  military tactics, skills, and drills. I also took responsibility of supervising the recruits during the basic training period as a Squad Leader.<br><br>

						I'm developing my skills in both design and programming. I've learned how to build mobile-first, dynamic, and responsive websites and web apps using my design skills in combination with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I've accomplished this through frameworks such as Bootstrap and AngularJS, and libraries like jQuery and Ajax. This year, I'm looking forward to learn about Database Management, Interactive Information Visualization, Server-Side Web Development and Project Management.</h4> -->
